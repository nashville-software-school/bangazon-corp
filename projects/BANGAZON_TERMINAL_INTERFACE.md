Once the order is complete, show the main menu again, where the user can start creating another order.

Diapers           50          10        $640.95
Case of Cracki... 40          30        $270.96

1. The product column must be 18 characters wide, and will display a maximum of 17 characters for the product name.
1. The orders column must be 11 characters wide.
1. The customers column must be 11 characters wide.
1. The revenue column must be 15 characters wide.

# Requirements

You will create a series of prompts that will allow the user to create various types of data in your ordering system.

1. Start with writing unit tests. As a group, determine the core functionality of the application. Define classes and methods that you think you need to build. Do that before writing the implementation code for core logic. DO NOT WRITE TESTS FOR THE USER INTERFACE (menu and prompts).

## Test Discovery

It explains how you can run all tests inside a directory. This allows you to split your unit test suite into many, smaller, more maintainable modules, and the use a pattern matcher to find tests in all matching files.

Insert command line snippet
```

## Optional: Code Coverage

You can use the ??? tool to ensure that your test suite has 100% coverage of your application's logic.
